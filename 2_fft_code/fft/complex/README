This fft(3) package does Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform on an arbitrary
number of complex samples.

How to make the stuff:
	make		- create library "fft.a"
	make fft.man	- nroff manual page "fft.3" into "fft.man"
	make print	- print source, "tech" and "fft.man"

File "tech" contains a short description of the functions and variables in the
implementation.

Programs using fft(3), should include "../complex.h" and be loaded (ld(1)) with
libraries "fft.a" and "/usr/lib/libm.a".  The package also uses malloc(3) of
the standard C-library.
